# Temperature_Humidity_SensorNode_PCB_Layout
This Sensor Node is designed for IoT applications, leveraging the ESP32-H2-MINI-1-N4 for Thread and BLE communication to transmit temperature and humidity data to a remote gateway. The design features a USB interface for power only, an SHT40 sensor for precise environmental monitoring, and a buck converter to efficiently regulate 5V and 3.3V power.
